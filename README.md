## Description: 

This is simple Java program represents the coffee machine. The program contains one class and 5 methods: start(); buy(); fill(); remaining(); take();


The class use system input to handle input that comes to it via these methods and its string argument.

This system simulates pretty accurately how real-world electronic devices work. External components (like buttons on the coffee machine or tapping on the screen) generate events that pass into the single interface of the program.
